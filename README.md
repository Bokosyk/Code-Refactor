# Code-Refactor
<p>An exercise in taking pre-existing code and refactoring it to make it more accessible. The purpose of this project is to sharpen my knowledge on HTML semantic elements, learn how to consolidate CSS properties and selectors, and how to ultimately improve code to be more readable to both developers and web browsers.</p>
